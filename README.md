# GetSoundscapeFn
Garry's Mod binary module for getting the player's active soundscape entity.  

⚠️ **It is very possible this module will stop working when the next Garry's Mod**  
**update is released.  I'll figure it out when I get around to it.** ⚠️

## Summary  
This Garry's Mod binary module adds the function `Player.GetSoundscapeEntity` to  
your server.  
This is a **server-only** module since client-side binary modules are too much  
of a hassle to distribute.  

## Specifications
This module was built for 32-bit (base branch) servers.  It will not work on  
64-bit games or servers.  
I tried building for 64-bit and it failed to build, so I didn't bother.  
This module uses **manual offsets** that were obtained on 2025.08.26.  
EXE version 2025.03.26 and EXE build 9748.  
After updates, it is possible this module will not work.  
This module was built as `ReleaseWithSymbols`.

## Installation and Running
The easiest way to use this module is to download the DLL file from the Releases  
section on the right.  
There is a Windows release and a Linux release.  
Remember that these are **server-only**.  
Place this DLL in your game/server's `garrysmod/lua/bin` folder.  If you do not  
have a `bin` folder, create it.  
In case you don't know, the DLL file for Linux is really an SO file, renamed,  
so **do not** rename this module for Linux.  
In a Lua file somewhere, add `require( "getsoundscapefn" )` before any time you  
use `player:GetSoundscapeEntity()`.

## Notes
If the player does not have an active soundscape, this function will return  
`Weapon [NULL]`.  This entity passes `ent.IsWeapon` but fails `IsValid( ent )`.  
Like every entity-returning function in this game, you should make sure it's  
valid before doing anything with it.  
I wanted to make this return `[NULL Entity]` instead, but I just kept causing  
crashes.

## Building
The harder way to install it would be to set up a module workspace and build it  
yourself.  There's next to no documentation for this so I only recommend you do  
this if you know what you're doing.

## Contributing
This is the first binary module I've made for Garry's Mod, so it's very possible  
I've done something horribly wrong.  Make requests, report issues, do whatever  
you want.
